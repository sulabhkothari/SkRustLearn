// The borrow method returns the smart pointer type Ref<T>, and borrow_mut returns the smart pointer
// type RefMut<T>. Both types implement Deref, so we can treat them like regular references.

// The RefCell<T> keeps track of how many Ref<T> and RefMut<T> smart pointers are currently active.
// Every time we call borrow, the RefCell<T> increases its count of how many immutable borrows are
// active. When a Ref<T> value goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one.
// Just like the compile-time borrowing rules, RefCell<T> lets us have many immutable borrows or one
// mutable borrow at any point in time.

// Your code would incur a small runtime performance penalty as a result of keeping track of the
// borrows at runtime rather than compile time. However, using RefCell<T> makes it possible to write
// a mock object that can modify itself to keep track of the messages it has seen while youâ€™re using
// it in a context where only immutable values are allowed. You can use RefCell<T> despite its
// trade-offs to get more functionality than regular references provide.
